README (♡˙︶˙♡)

- since this is the first read me, just note that future read mes will be added above and not below!
- clientid/secret is currently shya's (this will change in the future!),
if you face an error in redirect uri, it is most likely that it's not whitelisted on shya's spotify web api app end
so use your own clientid/secret and whitelist it OR let me know and i will whitelist your redirect uri!
- added the base files, but important files to note are the index.html and app.js which will be where most of the changes occur

PROBLEMS TO FIX ヾ(`ヘ´)ﾉﾞ	

[] Device not automatically obtained upon page load, requires a page reload for it to appear
[] Mobile responsiveness (to-check)
[] Fix Spotify Web SDK not working
[] Complete the modal (mayhaps make it slide out from the right and make it less intrusive)
[] Store clientID/secret in database
