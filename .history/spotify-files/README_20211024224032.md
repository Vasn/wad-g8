README (♡˙︶˙♡)	

23-24 OCT 2021
- fixed track analysis
- fixed dropdown menu
- redesigned modal (decided that it is OK to not make it slide out from right)

19 OCT 2021
- made the buttons cute, used Vue

16 OCT 2021
- since this is the first read me, just note that future read mes will be added above and not below!
- clientid/secret is currently shya's (this will change in the future!),
if you face an error in redirect uri, it is most likely that it's not whitelisted on shya's spotify web api app end
so use your own clientid/secret and whitelist it OR let me know and i will whitelist your redirect uri!
- added the base files, but important files to note are the index.html and app.js which will be where most of the changes occur
