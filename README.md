    <br />
    Audiophiles is a digital audio streaming and media provider, which gives users an immersive 3D audio and visual experience with all genres of music. It inherently allows users to upload and listen to music that they have created as well as from their own Spotify Playlists. 
    <br />
    The team would like users to relive the days of owning their own Hi-fi system where you could watch the movement of the music’s soundwaves, but in a manner where it's interactive and curated to their own music playlist.

How did we came about with this idea? The idea was initally orginated from the old windows media player, we thought that nowadays music comes in the form of just genre and like there isn't much visualization going about, so we came up with an idea similar to how we used to visualize music through using the old media players. Using that as a concept, we tried implementing beats and frequencies to react with the music so as to project the scenes to users on how music can be visualize. Not only that, we brainstormed further, knowing that Spotify is an app that users use most often, we capitalize on that to blend in with our creation, to allow users to visualize music not only from their spotify but also through uploading mp3 files from their devices as well.
